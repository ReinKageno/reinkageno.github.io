          <p>Confusion mounts, tasks overwhelm, disaster strikes. As an introvert, I have to face various clashes and a hard life in social life.</p>
          <p>
            Why doesn't everyone understand, it's as if they know that I can't do it but they keep burdening me with it? <br>
            Why does no one really understand except two people? Even though they don't know the roots, I can only reflect and stay in the corner.
          </p>
          <p>
            No one helped, everyone was busy with their own work, I just sat helpless about my task. Tasks that other people think are easy, are very difficult for me. <br>
            I don't understand, and they don't want to understand either... It all happened very slowly but also quickly, I don't know how to explain it. I was so stupid, opening the bill message that the status was read. <br>
            Of course they will ask, "Why do you only read it?" and even charged me on all social media, and yeah I hate social media. Can you explain to me about the assignment without having to go through online messages?
          </p>
          <p>
            Annoyed with myself, I just closed everything, I really wanted to delete all applications related to outsiders. Life is strange, why can people be happy and easy to live their lives? <br>
            Well, maybe it's because they don't care about nature? or because they are extroverts? Or maybe I'm different from them? If it's true, why do they equate me and share the heavy tasks they bear? <br>
          </p>
          <p>
            I feel increasingly pressured to work with people who are experts, but can't understand other people. I felt like I couldn't do anything in my job, they then saw me as an insect or pest that could thwart their plans. <br>
            I'd rather work with people who are stupid but can understand other people, because that way I can socialize a little more easily, don't they care about introverted people? or do they not acknowledge our existence?
          </p>
          <p>
            I know there must always be a way out, but why? WHY does it always have to be like that before I find a way out? <br>
            A FAIR world? Do they think so? share the burden equally without considering the capacity of others? They say it's easy? Oh definitely not in my opinion, all other people's problems can't be compared. <br>
            They know there are a lot of poor people in their city, and they think that getting 1 dollar is easy? So why don't they give that 1 dollar bill to poor people everywhere??
