          <P>
            WHY, Why every I watched an anime and everything is related to Destiny. World! Why you do it? Pain, and war... What do you want from me, World?
          </P>
          <p>
            But, thanks... I learn a lot from anime, no matter if I'm a weeaboo. But why? Every new year... I'm sad. Nobody wanted to hear me, but I felt like I was talking to someone invisible, they were from another world. <br>
            I always want to hear the world, but I'm just a weak person.. "WHY" I always ask myself that, I don't know. I cried without anyone noticing me. I'm sad without anyone caring about me, I'm angry without anyone who can help me. <br>
            I want know, why I'm not scary about death, I think this life just a joke in a game..
          </p>
          <p>
            I wrote this half drunk because I was sleepy, I couldn't write without this condition. <br>
            I think it wasn't me who wrote this, and somehow I'm still aware of what I wrote. <br>
            Drunk? I mean, I'm drunk because I'm so sleepy. I think I'm dreaming as I write this, I don't think I'm here, not on earth.
          </p>

            Sleepy... I think I will continue later.
